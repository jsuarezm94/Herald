# Herald

_Herald_ is a location-based messaging app that is meant to act as your personal assistant in delivering messages for you.

How many times have you forgotten to notify your parents, friends, or colleagues that you reached a certain place? _Herald_ will help users send the messages they always forget to send, whether it is when landing in a new city, getting safely home at night, or leaving to pick someone up for a party.

**The key features include:**
* Schedule a message now; send it based on future locations through the app's notification system
* Complete control over the geotification: entry/exit mode, location, size, message, and recipients
* Access phone's contacts and create groups
* Access message templates or customize your own


**_Herald_ has four main tabs:**
* Outbox: map view and list view of all scheduled messages – scheduled messages can be deleted from the map view using the annotation
* Compose: simple form that gives the user full control over the geotification specifics – fill out all the fields before scheduling the geotification 
* Contacts: view, add, or delete groups of contacts that can be selected as recipients when composing a message
* Templates: view, add or delete message templates that can be used when composing a message


**The main libraries and toolkits used in _Herald_ are:**
* CoreLocation,
* MapKit
* MessageUI
* ContactsUI
* MKAnnotation
